# FranzPortable

Get back on top of your messaging.

Franz Portable is the former Emperor of Austria - but also a messaging 
app that combines chat & messaging services into one application. 
Franz currently supports Slack, WhatsApp, WeChat, Facebook Messenger, 
Telegram, Google Hangouts, GroupMe, Skype and many more. It's packaged 
with a PortableApps.com launcher as a portable app, so you can use it
from a cloud folder, portable drive, or local folder without needing to install it on each PC.
